# DataQuest-R-Projects
This is list of the projects I created suggested by DataQuest (https://www.dataquest.io).

## Investigating COVID-19 Virus Trends
In this beginner-level R project, you'll step into the role of a data analyst exploring the global COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. Leveraging R and the powerful dplyr library, you'll manipulate, filter, and aggregate a comprehensive dataset containing information on COVID-19 cases, tests, and hospitalizations across different countries. By applying data wrangling techniques such as grouping and summarizing, you'll uncover which countries have the highest rates of positive COVID-19 tests relative to their testing numbers. This hands-on project will not only strengthen your R programming skills and analytical thinking but also provide valuable experience in deriving actionable insights from real-world health data â€“ a crucial skill in today's data-driven healthcare landscape.
